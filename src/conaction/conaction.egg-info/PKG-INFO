The code in this repository is intended to support researchers analyzing multivariate data.

The thesis provides an extensive background reading for this package, and can be found at (link needed).

## Installation
ConAction is available through [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/conaction/), and can be installed via `pip` using
```
pip install conaction
```
or 
```
pip3 install conaction
```

## Example Usage

```python
from conaction import estimators
import numpy as np

X = np.random.normal(size=1000).reshape((100,10)) # Get a 100 x 10 data table

estimators.pearson_correlation(X) # Compute the 10-linear Pearson correlation coefficient
```
