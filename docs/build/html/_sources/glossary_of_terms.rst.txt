    Coefficient of determination
        The square of the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient.

    Correlation
        Either a linear relationship between linear variables or a statistical dependence in general.

    Kendall rank correlation coefficient
        The average of the number of concordant pairs minus the number of discordant pairs.

        A generalization of a sphere to more than 3 dimensions.

    Hyperspherical coordinates

    Pearson product-momment correlation coefficient
        A bilinear function that quantifies the linear relationship between two random variables.

    Spearman's rho correlation coefficient
